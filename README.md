# Flutter Architecture Patterns

A collection of Flutter projects demonstrating different architecture patterns for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## 📚 Projects

### 1. MVC Architecture Pattern
Located in `mvc_architeture_pattern/`
- Demonstrates Model-View-Controller pattern
- Clean separation of data, UI, and business logic

### 2. MVVM Architecture Pattern with GetX
Located in `mvvm_architeture_pattern/`
- Demonstrates Model-View-ViewModel pattern
- Uses GetX for reactive state management
- Features:
  - Counter app with increment/decrement/reset
  - Notes app with add/delete functionality
  - Dark/Light theme support
  - Reactive UI updates with GetX observables

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding different architecture patterns in Flutter development. Each project is:
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ Production-ready structure
- ✅ Best practices implementation
- ✅ Clean and maintainable code

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project has its own README with detailed instructions. Navigate to the specific project folder and follow the setup instructions.

### General Requirements
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
